# FreeRTOS Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple FreeRTOS-based projects demonstrating key real-time operating system concepts. 

## Features
- **Tasks**: Basic multitasking with FreeRTOS.
- **Periodic Tasks**: Implementing tasks that run at fixed intervals.
- **Idle Hook**: Custom idle task execution.
- **Queues**: Inter-task communication using message queues.
- **Semaphores**: Synchronization between tasks.
- **Mutexes**: Avoiding race conditions in shared resources.

These examples serve as a foundation for understanding FreeRTOS and real-time embedded system development.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository and use an appropriate toolchain (e.g., STM32CubeIDE, Keil, GCC) to compile and run the projects.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SolomonSelva/Embedded_RTOS.git
